**Hello, I'm Eley!** I am a PhD student studying robotics & AI in the [Stanford ARMLab](https://arm.stanford.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Monroe Kennedy III](https://profiles.stanford.edu/monroe-kennedy). My current research involves developing cooperative robotic agents for **human-robot** joint action tasks, and evaluating how well they work with humans. I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I was fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Nanshu Lu](https://sites.utexas.edu/nanshulu/) on studying the mechanics of stretchable electronics. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University.

This course focuses on how robots can be effective teammates with other robots and human partners. Concepts and tools were reviewed for characterizing task objectives, robot perception and control, teammate behavioral modeling, inter-agent communication, and team consensus. Course involves teaching through literature review, research proposals, and group project working with real robots (Interbotix LoCoBot) in ROS/Python/C++. (I received a **5.00/5.00** median score for instruction effectiveness, with a 89.0%, or 16/18, survey response rate.)
